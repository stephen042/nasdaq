                                        The user’s strategy must be responsible and consistent during the whole trading
                                        period. The user’s trading must demonstrate that their strategy works in the
                                        long term and is not based on pure luck. If the user places
                                        an unusually large number of orders for the Services within an unreasonably
                                        short period of time or places unusually large or small orders compared to
                                        previous trades, it will be considered as harmful or gambling behavior
                                        of the Customer. To specify the limit of what is considered a large order, a
                                        user is not allowed to risk more than 2.00% of the initial account balance on
                                        one trade idea including split positions. Split positions that are considered as
                                        one trade idea are as follows: (1) If the trades on the same symbol is floating
                                        or open at the same time at one point in the same direction and (2) the trades
                                        on the same symbol and direction were closed and opened within 2 minutes of each
                                        other. In such cases, the Provider reserves the right to suspend any further
                                        orders of the Services by the Customer and has the right to terminate the user’s
                                        account. If we identify that the unusual behavior as per this paragraph relates
                                        to the Customer&#x27;s involvement in Forbidden Trading Practices, we may take

                                        Terms and Conditions(https://{{ env('APP_NAME')}}.com/terms). The Provider reserves
                                        the right to determine, at its own discretion, the nature of the behavior
                                        described above and reasonable boundaries for such determination.<br><br>1.2.5

                                        are granted only after an interview with our Risk Management
                                        team. Without such granted exception(s), users who take unreasonable risks may

                                        The company will attempt to find a remedy for the situation. However, should

                                        Any form of arbitrage performed in your trading account - e.g., usage of
                                        specialized software programs that are designed to exploit possible price
                                        latencies on a Trading Platform or that allow for the use of technological
                                        and/or algorithmic trading patterns that are aimed at exploiting price
                                        latency/priced freezes for arbitrage opportunities on a Trading Platform, thus
                                        resulting in unrealistic and/or fake profits on a trading account,
                                        which would not be possible within the real trading environment. Any form of HFT
                                        or HFT-like trading systems are not applicable to live market conditions due to
                                        latency, commission, spread, and slippage limitations.
                                        Any form of martingale and grid trading strategies is not tolerated due to its
                                        nature of high leverage and high risk over a large series of trades. Abuse of
                                        technological issues of a broker, intentional or otherwise,
                                        where opening and closing prices might be readjusted and users will be able to
                                        continue trading, which would decrease the profitability or increase the loss,
                                        this data will not be taken into account for ‘passing qualification’.
                                        Usage of guaranteed ‘Take Profit’ and ‘Stop Loss’ to trade news/price and
                                        weekend gaps, due to its possibility in a demo account.</p>

                                    <p>2.6 Difference between Demo and Real Accounts. The user confirms a good
                                        understanding of major differences between Live and Demo trading, which include
                                        but are not limited to the following: In most cases – Demo accounts
                                        have better prices and abnormal execution behavior relative to the markets.
                                        Therefore, a user has to consider that an employed trading system should be able
                                        to perform profitably in a real market scenario, even with
                                        a slightly less favorable spread. Demo accounts have no or very little
                                        (artificial) slippage, due to no real liquidity. Unlike Demo accounts, Real
                                        accounts with trades over 1 Standard Lot might not be filled immediately
                                        or fully on a Real Account. On a real account ‘Stop Loss’ and ‘Take Profit’ are
                                        filled only at the level of the closest available liquidity, not at the level of
                                        a set price. Orders on Demo accounts are executed at the

                                    <p>If the Customer is successful in both the Evaluation and Verification, the user
                                        will be recommended to the {{ env('APP_NAME')}} Trader Program, the proprietary
                                        trading platform operated by Evaluator and may be offered a contract
                                        by this third-party company. To get accepted to the {{ env('APP_NAME')}} Trader
                                        Program the user must open an account with Evaluator, provide required KYC
                                        documentation, and sign an agreement with a company. If the user is
                                        accepted to the program, the user can start trading at the same initial account
                                        size as the user was trading in the Trading Evaluation. The user can also start
                                        earning performance commissions according to the agreement
                                        signed with the Proprietary Trading Company. All users are compensated on a
                                        profit-split basis only. User performance commission depends on the chosen
                                        program, risk level, and phase. The user may request a withdrawal
                                        of their commission when their account balance on Evaluator is at least $50 and
                                        when the payout schedule is due. Payments will be made by wire transfer or any
                                        other payment method available with Evaluator. Alternative
                                        payment methods may be available, however, the user must ensure that bank
                                        transfers are receivable by the institution. The evaluator will not be
                                        responsible for failure to deliver a payout due to mistakes on the user’s
                                        end. Nor will payment be re-sent in the event of rejection of transfer by the
                                        receiving foreign institution. The receiver may be charged by the payment

                                        have certain limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results
                                        do not represent actual trading. Also, because the tradeshave
                                        not actually been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for
                                        the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity.
                                        Simulated trading programs, in general, are also subject to the
                                        fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is
                                        being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses
