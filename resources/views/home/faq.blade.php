                                                want to make sure
                                                that you have regular access to the hard earned profits you have made.

                                                for the trader and 20% to us. The good news is, you may upgrade your
                                                profit split to 90% or 100% when you purchase the add-on through our

                                                skill and knowledge, but also discipline and adherence to rules.
                                                <br><br>Therefore, we require all traders to follow the basic rules set
                                                out in our plan, which
                                                includes daily and total drawdown limits. We believe that this helps to
                                                manage risk and prevent large losses that could wipe out your

                                                through glitches or high-frequency trading, as we believe in fair and

                                                to trade new events and to hold positions overnight or over weekends.
                                                <br><br>We believe that these opportunities can lead to profitable
                                                trades and increased earnings potential. It&#x27;s important to note
                                                that we are looking for profitable traders who can make us both money.
                                                <br><br>Therefore, traders who consistently violate our rules or fail to
                                                generate profits may not be a good fit for our challenge. <br><br>We
