                                                skill and knowledge, but also discipline and adherence to rules.
                                                <br><br>Therefore, we require all traders to follow the basic rules set
                                                out in our plan, which
                                                includes daily and total drawdown limits. We believe that this helps to
                                                manage risk and prevent large losses that could wipe out your

                                                to trade new events and to hold positions overnight or over weekends.
                                                <br><br>We believe that these opportunities can lead to profitable
                                                trades and increased earnings potential. It&#x27;s important to note
                                                that we are looking for profitable traders who can make us both money.
